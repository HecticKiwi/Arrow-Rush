# Arrow-Rush
My first attempt at coding a game :3

Just press the arrow key corresponding to the one shown on the screen.
However, if the arrow is red then you must press in the opposite direction!
You play on a timer that becomes shorter with each successive press.
Wrong inputs will take a chunk out of the timer.
How long can you last before you hesitate too long or flub too many inputs?
